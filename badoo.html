	<h1>Who is badoo?</h1>

	<h5> 0.2 | It's not a pink bunny! It's Badoo ꒰ A dream eater and homework eater ꒱</h5>

	<p id=inspo>Inspired by Baku from Yokai Watch and Japanese folklore of the Baku</p>

	<h5 id="question2"> What is a Baku? </h5>

	<p>A baku is a strange, holy beast that has a body of a bear, the head of an elephant, the eyes of a rhinoceros, the tail of an ox, and the legs of a tiger. Despite their monstrous appearance, baku are revered as powerful forces of good and as one of the holy protectors of mankind. Baku watch over humans and act as guardian spirits. They feed on the dreams of humans - specifically bad dreams (Yokai.com).</p>

	<h5 id="extensionidea"> The Extension Idea </h5>

	<p id="thirdparagraph">If you wake up from a bad dream, you can tell (more like type) whatever nightmare woke you up and Badoo will eat it. This also applies to any files you attach or anything of that sort. Please DO NOT attach any files or anything important including your homework. Badoo will gobble that up too.</p>

	<h5 id="personalityheader"> Personality </h5>

	<p>Badoo is a little cheeky, but for the most part like a little kid. She loves sleeping even when she's supposed to be awake at night eating your bad dreams. But will only eat your bad dreams if you manage to wake her up. She mispells most of her words just like the rest of us. Badoo will be doing all sorts of activities when you open the browser because Badoo also has a life! However when it's night time, (she'll know because she also shares the same time zone as you) Badoo will be asleep and you have to nudge her to wake up.</p>	

	<h5 id=extensionlook>How I Want the Extension to Look</h5>

	<p>First, the extension icon. I want it to be Badoo's face of course! She's the star of the show. I want Badoo to be a 3D modeled character. Something I find so charming are the dialogue boxes from Animal Crossing New Leaf and Yokai Watch. These will be inserted below. I'm definitely leaning towards a more rounded font like the one in Animal Crossing and maybe make the dialogue box a cloud shape when typing what your bad dream is. I'm still debating on whether it should be white or purple (signifying bad dreams). </p>
